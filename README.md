# Retinal-Disease-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-EfficientNetB3-and-DenseNet201-
This repository hosts a deep learning project for classifying retinal diseases using CNNs, targeting four conditions: Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, Glaucoma, and Normal retina. Leveraging EfficientNetB3 and DenseNet201 models, it aims to support early detection and diagnosis, aiding in effective treatment and vision loss prevention.
